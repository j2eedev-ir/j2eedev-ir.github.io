<p style="direction: ltr">
I'm a software developer with a huge passion in Java EE field. 
<br />
<br />
Besides my work as a Software Developer I'm helping/consulting developers to write java application and help them to define java classes.
<br />
<br />
I always like to test my code and always believed a piece of code without a well-written Test is bad code.
<br />
<br />
Finding the easiest, fastest and better solution is what I do best. I always look for the less-complicated ways to develop a feature or fix a bug. 
<br />
<br />
I spend my free time between Learning java, coding some cool stuff, reading some books, or just laying on the couch and thinking why i am a human!
